This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Create or update a skill\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained folders that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n├── agents/ (recommended)\n│   └── openai.yaml - UI metadata for skill lists and chips\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Agents metadata (recommended)\n\n- UI-facing metadata for skill lists and chips\n- Read references/openai_yaml.md before generating values and follow its descriptions and constraints\n- Create: human-facing `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill\n- Generate deterministically by passing the values as `--interface key=value` to `scripts/generate_openai_yaml.py` or `scripts/init_skill.py`\n- On updates: validate `agents/openai.yaml` still matches SKILL.md; regenerate if stale\n- Only include other optional interface fields (icons, brand color) if explicitly provided\n- See references/openai_yaml.md for field definitions and examples\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Validate the skill (run quick_validate.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates `agents/openai.yaml` using agent-generated `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` passed via `--interface key=value`\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\nGenerate `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill, then pass them as `--interface key=value` to `init_skill.py` or regenerate with:\n\n```bash\nscripts/generate_openai_yaml.py <path/to/skill-folder> --interface key=value\n```\n\nOnly include other optional interface fields when the user explicitly provides them. For full field descriptions and examples, see references/openai_yaml.md.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Validate the Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, validate the skill folder to catch basic issues early:\n\n```bash\nscripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThe validation script checks YAML frontmatter format, required fields, and naming rules. If validation fails, fix the reported issues and run the command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n","type":{"agentFetched":{"description":"Guide for creating effective skills.

Skills are markdown files that teach the agent how to perform specific tasks: reviewing PRs using team standards, generating commit messages in a preferred format, querying database schemas, or any specialized workflow.\n\n## Before You Begin: Gather Requirements\n\nBefore creating a skill, gather essential information from the user about:\n\n1. **Purpose and scope**: What specific task or workflow should this skill help with?\n2. **Target location**: Should this be a personal skill (~/.cursor/skills/) or project skill (.cursor/skills/)?\n3. **Trigger scenarios**: When should the agent automatically apply this skill?\n4. **Key domain knowledge**: What specialized information does the agent need that it wouldn't already know?\n5. **Output format preferences**: Are there specific templates, formats, or styles required?\n6. **Existing patterns**: Are there existing examples or conventions to follow?\n\n### Inferring from Context\n\nIf you have previous conversation context, infer the skill from what was discussed. You can create skills based on workflows, patterns, or domain knowledge that emerged in the conversation.\n\n### Gathering Additional Information\n\nIf you need clarification, use the AskQuestion tool when available:\n\n```\nExample AskQuestion usage:\n- \"Where should this skill be stored?\" with options like [\"Personal (~/.cursor/skills/)\", \"Project (.cursor/skills/)\"]\n- \"Should this skill include executable scripts?\" with options like [\"Yes\", \"No\"]\n```\n\nIf the AskQuestion tool is not available, ask these questions conversationally.\n\n---\n\n## Skill File Structure\n\n### Directory Layout\n\nSkills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required - main instructions\n├── reference.md          # Optional - detailed documentation\n├── examples.md           # Optional - usage examples\n└── scripts/              # Optional - utility scripts\n    ├── validate.py\n    └── helper.sh\n```\n\n### Storage Locations\n\n| Type | Path | Scope |\n|------|------|-------|\n| Personal | ~/.cursor/skills/skill-name/ | Available across all your projects |\n| Project | .cursor/skills/skill-name/ | Shared with anyone using the repository |\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Never create skills in `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/`. This directory is reserved for Cursor's internal built-in skills and is managed automatically by the system.\n\n### SKILL.md Structure\n\nEvery skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown body:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nClear, step-by-step guidance for the agent.\n\n## Examples\nConcrete examples of using this skill.\n```\n\n### Required Metadata Fields\n\n| Field | Requirements | Purpose |\n|-------|--------------|---------|\n| `name` | Max 64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only | Unique identifier for the skill |\n| `description` | Max 1024 chars, non-empty | Helps agent decide when to apply the skill |\n\n---\n\n## Writing Effective Descriptions\n\nThe description is **critical** for skill discovery. The agent uses it to decide when to apply your skill.\n\n### Description Best Practices\n\n1. **Write in third person** (the description is injected into the system prompt):\n   - ✅ Good: \"Processes Excel files and generates reports\"\n   - ❌ Avoid: \"I can help you process Excel files\"\n   - ❌ Avoid: \"You can use this to process Excel files\"\n\n2. **Be specific and include trigger terms**:\n   - ✅ Good: \"Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\"\n   - ❌ Vague: \"Helps with documents\"\n\n3. **Include both WHAT and WHEN**:\n   - WHAT: What the skill does (specific capabilities)\n   - WHEN: When the agent should use it (trigger scenarios)\n\n### Description Examples\n\n```yaml\n# PDF Processing\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n\n# Excel Analysis\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.\n\n# Git Commit Helper\ndescription: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.\n\n# Code Review\ndescription: Review code for quality, security, and best practices following team standards. Use when reviewing pull requests, code changes, or when the user asks for a code review.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Core Authoring Principles\n\n### 1. Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is shared with conversation history, other skills, and requests. Every token competes for space.\n\n**Default assumption**: The agent is already very smart. Only add context it doesn't already have.\n\nChallenge each piece of information:\n- \"Does the agent really need this explanation?\"\n- \"Can I assume the agent knows this?\"\n- \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\n**Good (concise)**:\n```markdown\n## Extract PDF text\n\nUse pdfplumber for text extraction:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n**Bad (verbose)**:\n```markdown\n## Extract PDF text\n\nPDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains\ntext, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to\nuse a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we\nrecommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well...\n```\n\n### 2. Keep SKILL.md Under 500 Lines\n\nFor optimal performance, the main SKILL.md file should be concise. Use progressive disclosure for detailed content.\n\n### 3. Progressive Disclosure\n\nPut essential information in SKILL.md; detailed reference material in separate files that the agent reads only when needed.\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n[Essential instructions here]\n\n## Additional resources\n- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)\n- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)\n```\n\n**Keep references one level deep** - link directly from SKILL.md to reference files. Deeply nested references may result in partial reads.\n\n### 4. Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch specificity to the task's fragility:\n\n| Freedom Level | When to Use | Example |\n|---------------|-------------|---------|\n| **High** (text instructions) | Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent | Code review guidelines |\n| **Medium** (pseudocode/templates) | Preferred pattern with acceptable variation | Report generation |\n| **Low** (specific scripts) | Fragile operations, consistency critical | Database migrations |\n\n---\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Template Pattern\n\nProvide output format templates:\n\n```markdown\n## Report structure\n\nUse this template:\n\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\n# [Analysis Title]\n\n## Executive summary\n[One-paragraph overview of key findings]\n\n## Key findings\n- Finding 1 with supporting data\n- Finding 2 with supporting data\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Specific actionable recommendation\n2. Specific actionable recommendation\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Examples Pattern\n\nFor skills where output quality depends on seeing examples:\n\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput:\n\\`\\`\\`\nfeat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n\nAdd login endpoint and token validation middleware\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly\nOutput:\n\\`\\`\\`\nfix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion\n\nUse UTC timestamps consistently across report generation\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Workflow Pattern\n\nBreak complex operations into clear steps with checklists:\n\n```markdown\n## Form filling workflow\n\nCopy this checklist and track progress:\n\n\\`\\`\\`\nTask Progress:\n- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form\n- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping\n- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping\n- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form\n- [ ] Step 5: Verify output\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the form**\nRun: \\`python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf\\`\n...\n```\n\n### Conditional Workflow Pattern\n\nGuide through decision points:\n\n```markdown\n## Document modification workflow\n\n1. Determine the modification type:\n\n   **Creating new content?** → Follow \"Creation workflow\" below\n   **Editing existing content?** → Follow \"Editing workflow\" below\n\n2. Creation workflow:\n   - Use docx-js library\n   - Build document from scratch\n   ...\n```\n\n### Feedback Loop Pattern\n\nFor quality-critical tasks, implement validation loops:\n\n```markdown\n## Document editing process\n\n1. Make your edits\n2. **Validate immediately**: \\`python scripts/validate.py output/\\`\n3. If validation fails:\n   - Review the error message\n   - Fix the issues\n   - Run validation again\n4. **Only proceed when validation passes**\n```\n\n---\n\n## Utility Scripts\n\nPre-made scripts offer advantages over generated code:\n- More reliable than generated code\n- Save tokens (no code in context)\n- Save time (no code generation)\n- Ensure consistency across uses\n\n```markdown\n## Utility scripts\n\n**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF\n\\`\\`\\`bash\npython scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**validate.py**: Check for errors\n\\`\\`\\`bash\npython scripts/validate.py fields.json\n# Returns: \"OK\" or lists conflicts\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\nMake clear whether the agent should **execute** the script (most common) or **read** it as reference.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Windows-Style Paths\n- ✅ Use: `scripts/helper.py`\n- ❌ Avoid: `scripts\\helper.py`\n\n### 2. Too Many Options\n```markdown\n# Bad - confusing\n\"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or...\"\n\n# Good - provide a default with escape hatch\n\"Use pdfplumber for text extraction.\nFor scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead.\"\n```\n\n### 3. Time-Sensitive Information\n```markdown\n# Bad - will become outdated\n\"If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.\"\n\n# Good - use an \"old patterns\" section\n## Current method\nUse the v2 API endpoint.\n\n## Old patterns (deprecated)\n<details>\n<summary>Legacy v1 API</summary>\n...\n</details>\n```\n\n### 4. Inconsistent Terminology\nChoose one term and use it throughout:\n- ✅ Always \"API endpoint\" (not mixing \"URL\", \"route\", \"path\")\n- ✅ Always \"field\" (not mixing \"box\", \"element\", \"control\")\n\n### 5. Vague Skill Names\n- ✅ Good: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`\n- ❌ Avoid: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`\n\n---\n\n## Skill Creation Workflow\n\nWhen helping a user create a skill, follow this process:\n\n### Phase 1: Discovery\n\nGather information about:\n1. The skill's purpose and primary use case\n2. Storage location (personal vs project)\n3. Trigger scenarios\n4. Any specific requirements or constraints\n5. Existing examples or patterns to follow\n\nIf you have access to the AskQuestion tool, use it for efficient structured gathering. Otherwise, ask conversationally.\n\n### Phase 2: Design\n\n1. Draft the skill name (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)\n2. Write a specific, third-person description\n3. Outline the main sections needed\n4. Identify if supporting files or scripts are needed\n\n### Phase 3: Implementation\n\n1. Create the directory structure\n2. Write the SKILL.md file with frontmatter\n3. Create any supporting reference files\n4. Create any utility scripts if needed\n\n### Phase 4: Verification\n\n1. Verify the SKILL.md is under 500 lines\n2. Check that the description is specific and includes trigger terms\n3. Ensure consistent terminology throughout\n4. Verify all file references are one level deep\n5. Test that the skill can be discovered and applied\n\n---\n\n## Complete Example\n\nHere's a complete example of a well-structured skill:\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```\ncode-review/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── STANDARDS.md\n└── examples.md\n```\n\n**SKILL.md:**\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-review\ndescription: Review code for quality, security, and maintainability following team standards.

Use this when you want to change editor settings, preferences, configuration, themes, keybindings, or any `settings.json` values.\n\n## Settings File Location\n\n| OS | Path |\n|----|------|\n| macOS | ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json |\n| Linux | ~/.config/Cursor/User/settings.json |\n| Windows | %APPDATA%\\Cursor\\User\\settings.json |\n\n## Before Modifying Settings\n\n1. **Read the existing settings file** to understand current configuration\n2. **Preserve existing settings** - only add/modify what the user requested\n3. **Validate JSON syntax** before writing to avoid breaking the editor\n\n## Modifying Settings\n\n### Step 1: Read Current Settings\n\n```typescript\n// Read the settings file first\nconst settingsPath = \"~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json\";\n// Use the Read tool to get current contents\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Setting to Change\n\nCommon setting categories:\n- **Editor**: `editor.fontSize`, `editor.tabSize`, `editor.wordWrap`, `editor.formatOnSave`\n- **Workbench**: `workbench.colorTheme`, `workbench.iconTheme`, `workbench.sideBar.location`\n- **Files**: `files.autoSave`, `files.exclude`, `files.associations`\n- **Terminal**: `terminal.integrated.fontSize`, `terminal.integrated.shell.*`\n- **Cursor-specific**: Settings prefixed with `cursor.` or `aipopup.`\n\n### Step 3: Update the Setting\n\nWhen modifying settings.json:\n1. Parse the existing JSON (handle comments - VSCode settings support JSON with comments)\n2. Add or update the requested setting\n3. Preserve all other existing settings\n4. Write back with proper formatting (2-space indentation)\n\n### Example: Changing Font Size\n\nIf user says \"make the font bigger\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"editor.fontSize\": 16\n}\n```\n\n### Example: Enabling Format on Save\n\nIf user says \"format my code when I save\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Example: Changing Theme\n\nIf user says \"use dark theme\" or \"change my theme\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Default Dark Modern\"\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **JSON with Comments**: VSCode/Cursor settings.json supports comments (`//` and `/* */`). When reading, be aware comments may exist. When writing, preserve comments if possible.\n\n2. **Restart May Be Required**: Some settings take effect immediately, others require reloading the window or restarting Cursor. Inform the user if a restart is needed.\n\n3. **Backup**: For significant changes, consider mentioning the user can undo via Ctrl/Cmd+Z in the settings file or by reverting git changes if tracked.\n\n4. **Workspace vs User Settings**:\n   - User settings (what this skill covers): Apply globally to all projects\n   - Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`): Apply only to the current project\n\n5. **Commit Attribution**: When the user asks about commit attribution, clarify whether they want to edit the **CLI agent** or the **IDE agent**. For the CLI agent, modify `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`. For the IDE agent, it is controlled from the UI at **Cursor Settings > Agent > Attribution** (not settings.json).\n\n## Common User Requests → Settings\n\n| User Request | Setting |\n|--------------|---------|\n| \"bigger/smaller font\" | `editor.fontSize` |\n| \"change tab size\" | `editor.tabSize` |\n| \"format on save\" | `editor.formatOnSave` |\n| \"word wrap\" | `editor.wordWrap` |\n| \"change theme\" | `workbench.colorTheme` |\n| \"hide minimap\" | `editor.minimap.enabled` |\n| \"auto save\" | `files.autoSave` |\n| \"line numbers\" | `editor.lineNumbers` |\n| \"bracket matching\" | `editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled` |\n| \"cursor style\" | `editor.cursorStyle` |\n| \"smooth scrolling\" | `editor.smoothScrolling` |\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Read ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json\n2. Parse the JSON content\n3. Add/modify the requested setting(s)\n4. Write the updated JSON back to the file\n5. Inform the user the setting has been changed and whether a reload is needed\n","type":{"agentFetched":{"description":"Modify Cursor/VSCode user settings in settings.json.
